Took me more than expected.
Looked for 30 minutes to find a missing letter in my JS code which made it to not do anything.
Could have done more like the options to add your own pictures to the slideshow and delete which ones you got bored of.
Most aggravating is that small line below images that did not get covered by the box-shadow and still don't know why its there in the first place.
